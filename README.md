# Tunelist
Tunelist is a Django web application which allows users to create their own custom music playlists out of YouTube videos.

If you're anything like me, and find yourself spending a lot of time on youtube listening to music, then hopefully you might find this useful.

# Contributing
This is only an initial prototype, and I am definitely still a Django noobie. If you having any suggestions on any features you would like to see added, or if you think you can organize the project in a more sensible way, then feel free to contribute! I'll certainly appreciate it, and the app will improve as well!
